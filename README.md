#printf
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This printf project is a collaboration between Tebogo Kgonothi and Ikenna Isiogu, students of Software Engineering at Alx africa. The project contains a function name "printf" which imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

The objective of the printf project is to learn the base functionality of printf, take those concepts and apply them ourselfves to create a new printf that works like the one in the library.

printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data on the screen.Its prototype is the following:

int _printf(const char *format, ...)
